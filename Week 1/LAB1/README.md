 Create a Linux virtual machine with the Azure CLI

I created a new folder on my desktop named: GITHUB_LOCAL_REPO
I downloaded Git bash on my desktop through google engine
I opened the Git Bash by right clicking on my mouse to click on GIT BASH HERE
GIT BASH TERMINAL will display Ismail-Schull tech@DESKTOP-3Q4EMU4 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/SCHULL TECH/GITHUB_LOCAL_ REPO/linux-bootcamp/linux-bootcamp (main)

And I input git init
it display Reinitialized existing Git repository in C:/Users/Ismail-Schull tech/Desktop/SCHULL TECH/GITHUB_LOCAL_ REPO/linux-bootcamp/linux-bootcamp/.git/

Then I input git clone and copy mikeplifer's code on his github platform in front it 
And 
display $ git clone https://github.com/CloudSkills/linux-bootcamp.git
fatal: destination path 'linux-bootcamp' already exists and is not an empty directory.
I have all the weeks assignment in my personal folder now.

I forked mikeplifer's to my own github account.
Thank you.




FOR LAB1 ASSIGNMENT
I tried to sign up for azure microsoft free account
It keeps rejecting my credit card 
i tried using another credit card 
It rejected it.
That is why i was unable to practice the assignment using Azure Platform
I am making use of AWS for now.
