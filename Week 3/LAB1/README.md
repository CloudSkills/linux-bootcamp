# Things Learnt From Week 3 labs

# 1. Creating a resource group
An azure resource group can be conceptualized as a folder which is used to group related, interdependent or logically linked Azure resources together.

When creating an Azure Resource Group, you need to specify the following:

1. The region you want the Resource Group to be located. 
2. The name of the Resource Group that is being created.

You can also add various resources you want, to be part of the Resource Group created.

*Please note that the reouseces present in a particular resource group should have a similar life cycle*
